1. Implement the flip() under component class
   probably we should not use string to represent the orientation, like'N'...
   I have tried to use enum in the global.h (in the comment), but there are some bugs there, you can try to fix it
2. Check the align function written by me
   I write it in hurry, so there may be corner cases I forget. 
3. Implement the Integer Linear Program algorithm we have discussed
